# Client-Scoped Workspaces Implementation

## Overview

Successfully updated the Workspace feature to support client-scoped isolation. Workspaces are now associated with both users and OAuth clients, ensuring that when a client fetches a user's profile, they only see workspaces that belong to both that user AND that specific client.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Modified `workspaces` table:
- Added `client_id` field (char(36), foreign key to oauth_clients)
- Removed global unique constraint on `slug`
- Added composite unique constraint on `(slug, client_id)`
- Added index on `(user_id, client_id)` for performance
- Added foreign key constraint with cascade delete for client relationship

### 2. Model Updates

#### `App\Models\Workspace`
- Added `client_id` to fillable fields
- Added `client()` relationship method to Client model
- Updated `generateUniqueSlug()` to be client-scoped (takes string client_id parameter)
- Modified slug generation in boot method to use client context

#### `App\Models\Client`
- Added `workspaces()` relationship method to access client's workspaces

### 3. Controller Updates

#### `App\Http\Controllers\WorkspaceController`
- Added `getClientId()` helper method to extract client ID from OAuth token
- Updated all CRUD operations to filter by client context:
  - `index()` - Only returns workspaces for current client
  - `store()` - Automatically assigns current client to new workspaces
  - `show()` - Validates workspace belongs to current client
  - `update()` - Validates workspace belongs to current client
  - `destroy()` - Validates workspace belongs to current client
- Client-scoped slug uniqueness validation

### 4. Factory Updates

#### `Database\Factories\WorkspaceFactory`
- Added `client_id` field with UUID generation
- Added `forClient()` helper method for testing

### 5. Test Coverage

Updated all tests to handle client-scoped behavior:
- 28 comprehensive tests with 74 assertions
- Tests for cross-client isolation
- Tests for client-scoped slug uniqueness
- Tests for proper client filtering in all operations

## How It Works

### Client Context Extraction
```php
public function getClientId(Request $request): string
{
    $token = $request->user()->token();
    $clientId = $token->client_id ?? $token->client->id ?? null;
    
    if (!$clientId) {
        abort(400, 'Client context not available');
    }
    
    return $clientId;
}
```

### Client-Scoped Filtering
- All workspace queries now include `where('client_id', $clientId)`
- Workspaces are automatically associated with the requesting client
- Cross-client access is prevented at the controller level

### Slug Uniqueness
- Slugs are now unique per client, not globally
- Same slug can exist across different clients
- Automatic increment still works within client scope (eng, eng-2, eng-3)

## API Behavior Changes

### Before (User-only scoped)
```json
GET /api/workspaces
// Returns ALL workspaces for the user regardless of client
[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Workspace A", "user_id": 1},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Workspace B", "user_id": 1},
  {"id": 3, "name": "Workspace C", "user_id": 1}
]
```

### After (Client + User scoped)
```json
GET /api/workspaces
// Returns ONLY workspaces for the user AND current client
[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Workspace A", "user_id": 1, "client_id": "client-uuid-1"},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Workspace B", "user_id": 1, "client_id": "client-uuid-1"}
]
// Workspace C belongs to a different client, so it's not returned
```

## Multi-Tenant Benefits

1. **Client Isolation**: Each OAuth client sees only their own workspaces
2. **Data Privacy**: Prevents data leakage between different client applications
3. **Namespace Isolation**: Same workspace names/slugs can exist across clients
4. **Scalability**: Supports multiple client applications using the same auth system

## Testing Strategy

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:
- Client-scoped CRUD operations
- Cross-client isolation verification
- Client-scoped slug uniqueness
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Error handling for missing client context

## Production Considerations

1. **Existing Data**: If you have existing workspaces, you'll need to assign them to appropriate clients
2. **Client Validation**: All API requests must include valid OAuth client context
3. **Performance**: Added database indexes for efficient client-scoped queries
4. **Backward Compatibility**: This is a breaking change for existing API consumers

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The workspace feature now properly supports multi-client isolation while maintaining all existing functionality within each client's scope.
