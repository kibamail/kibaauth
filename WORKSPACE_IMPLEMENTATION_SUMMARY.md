# Workspace Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a complete Workspace API feature for the KibaAuth Laravel 12 application with Laravel Passport authentication. This implementation provides full CRUD operations for workspaces with proper security, validation, and client-scoped unique slug handling. Workspaces are now associated with both users and OAuth clients, ensuring proper multi-tenant isolation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Layer

#### Migration: `2025_08_12_091035_create_workspaces_table.php`
- Created `workspaces` table with:
  - `id` (primary key)
  - `name` (string, required)
  - `slug` (string, required)
  - `user_id` (foreign key to users table with cascade delete)
  - `client_id` (char(36), foreign key to oauth_clients table with cascade delete)
  - `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
  - Unique constraint on `slug, client_id` for client-scoped uniqueness
  - Index on `user_id, client_id` for performance

#### Model: `App\Models\Workspace`
- Mass assignable fields: `name`, `slug`, `user_id`, `client_id`
- Automatic slug generation from name if not provided
- Client-scoped unique slug enforcement with auto-incrementing (e.g., `eng`, `eng-2`, `eng-3` per client)
- `belongsTo` relationship with User model
- `belongsTo` relationship with Client model
- Proper model boot method for client-scoped slug generation

### 2. User Model Updates

#### Updated: `App\Models\User`
- Added `HasApiTokens` trait for Laravel Passport support
- Added `hasMany` relationship to workspaces
- Imported necessary Passport and Eloquent relationship classes

### 3. API Layer

#### Controller: `App\Http\Controllers\WorkspaceController`
- Full resource controller with all CRUD operations:
  - `index()` - List user's workspaces for current client (ordered by creation date, desc)
  - `store()` - Create new workspace with client-scoped unique slug handling
  - `show()` - Display specific workspace (with user and client ownership validation)
  - `update()` - Update workspace (with user and client ownership validation and slug conflict handling)
  - `destroy()` - Delete workspace (with user and client ownership validation)
- Client context extraction from OAuth token
- Client-scoped filtering for all operations
- Proper JSON responses with data and message structure
- Laravel Policy-based authorization for all operations

#### Request Validation: `App\Http\Requests\StoreWorkspaceRequest`
- Validates workspace creation requests
- Rules: `name` (required, string, max:255), `slug` (optional, string, max:255, alpha_dash)
- Custom validation messages
- Automatic authorization check
- Client context is automatically extracted from OAuth token

### 4. Routes

#### Updated: `routes/workspaces.php`
- API resource routes with `auth:api` middleware (Laravel Passport)
- Proper `/api` prefix
- All standard REST endpoints:
  - `GET /api/workspaces` - List workspaces
  - `POST /api/workspaces` - Create workspace
  - `GET /api/workspaces/{id}` - Show workspace
  - `PUT/PATCH /api/workspaces/{id}` - Update workspace
  - `DELETE /api/workspaces/{id}` - Delete workspace

### 5. Testing Layer

#### Factory: `Database\Factories\WorkspaceFactory`
- Complete factory for workspace model testing
- Helper methods: `withName()`, `withSlug()`, `forUser()`, `forClient()`
- Proper faker data generation with UUID client_id

#### Test Files:
1. **`WorkspaceTest.php`** - Core API functionality tests (28 tests)

Total: **28 comprehensive tests** covering:
- Authentication requirements
- CRUD operations
- Client-scoped slug uniqueness and collision handling
- User and client ownership enforcement
- Cross-client isolation
- Input validation
- Edge cases and error scenarios

### 6. Documentation

#### Created: `WORKSPACE_API.md`
- Complete API documentation with:
  - Authentication instructions
  - All endpoint specifications
  - Request/response examples
  - Error handling documentation
  - Usage examples with cURL commands
  - Database schema reference

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Client-Scoped Unique Slug Management
- Automatic slug generation from workspace names
- Client-scoped slug uniqueness (unique per OAuth client)
- Automatic increment on conflicts within client scope (`eng` → `eng-2` → `eng-3`)
- Same slug allowed across different clients
- Handles complex names with special characters properly
- Works with both provided slugs and auto-generated ones

### ✅ Security & Authorization
- Laravel Passport authentication on all endpoints
- Laravel Policy-based authorization system
- Users can only access their own workspaces within their current OAuth client's scope
- Client context extracted from OAuth token
- Multi-tenant isolation between clients
- Proper 401/403 error responses for unauthorized access

### ✅ Full CRUD Operations
- **Create**: POST with name and optional slug (auto-assigned to current client)
- **Read**: GET all user workspaces for current client and GET specific workspace
- **Update**: PUT/PATCH with partial updates supported (client-scoped)
- **Delete**: DELETE with proper cleanup (client-scoped)

### ✅ Input Validation
- Required name field validation
- String length limits (255 characters)
- Slug format validation (alpha_dash)
- Custom error messages

### ✅ Laravel Best Practices
- Resource routes using `apiResource()`
- Form Request validation classes
- Laravel Policy authorization system
- Eloquent relationships
- Factory pattern for testing
- Proper HTTP status codes (403 for unauthorized, 401 for unauthenticated)
- JSON API responses

## Testing Coverage

All tests pass with **74 assertions** across **28 tests**:

### Test Categories:
- **Authentication Tests**: Passport token validation
- **CRUD Tests**: All endpoint operations with client scoping
- **Validation Tests**: Input validation and error handling
- **Authorization Tests**: Policy-based access control with client isolation
- **Model Tests**: Database relationships and client-scoped slug generation
- **Edge Case Tests**: Client-scoped slug conflicts and cross-client isolation

## Usage Example

```bash
# Create a workspace
curl -X POST http://your-domain.com/api/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-passport-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Engineering Team", "slug": "eng"}'

# List workspaces
curl -X GET http://your-domain.com/api/workspaces \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-passport-token"
```

## Ready for Future Extensions

The implementation is structured to easily support:
- Team management within workspaces
- Role-based permissions per client
- Workspace settings and configurations
- Additional workspace metadata
- Workspace invitations and member management
- Cross-client workspace sharing (if needed)
